Neural network face detection using a dataset with my face. 

Note: The model works well using one face in the camera, and also works fine using another face different from me

For test and use the model, you could download the file "main.py"
In the same folder with the file, you need to have the model file, you can download in the following link:

Make sure you have install the libraries: OpenCV and Tensorflow


If you want to see the bulding process you could see the notebook "FaceDetection-es 260601 .ipynb"

This application was made following the tutorial of Nicholas Renotte in the following youtube video https://youtu.be/N_W4EYtsa10
